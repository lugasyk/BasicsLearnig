The first trailer for a new origin movie about iconic comic book villain The Joker has been released.
It shows Joaquin Phoenix undergoing a painful transformation from a decent chap into Batman's cackling nemesis.
Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, a stand-up comedian who gradually loses touch with reality after a series of hardships.
The first trailer for Todd Phillips' film - out on 4 October - was premiered this week at the CinemaCon convention in Las Vegas.

"My mother always tells me to smile and put on a happy face," Fleck is heard telling his therapist.

"She told me I had a purpose... to bring laughter and joy to the world."

Phoenix's character is then heard asking: "Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?"

The Joker trailer goes on to show Fleck dancing with his mother, going on a date with a girl and laughing maniacally at a stand-up comedian.

It then takes a dark turn when he's labelled "a freak" and and attacked by men on the subway.

"I used to think my life was a tragedy," his Joker concludes. " But now I realise it's a comedy."
